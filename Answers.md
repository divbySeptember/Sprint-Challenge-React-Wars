1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? React is a library that allows for a virtual DOM to be created and then pushes only the things that have changed on the virtual DOM to actual DOM. So it makes changes that only affect the changed elements, not the whole page/app.

2. What does it mean to _think_ in react? It means that you think about how to build your app as you are builidng it in React. Meaning you build components that use other components.

3. Briefly describe some of the differences between a Class/Stateful component and a Functional/Presentational component. Class components contain state, while functional components do not. Functional components have one purpose/function that they are supposed to carry out while Class components can be more complicated.

4. Describe state. State is where data is stored to be rendered. Components can access state, but not change it directly.

5. Describe props. Props are the state that is being passed into components.
